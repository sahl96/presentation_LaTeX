# Full presentation done on LaTeX

This project successfully created a full presentation using only LaTeX. 

I believe LaTeX is much better than mainstream choices like Microsoft Powerpoint, because:

1) It is free 
2) It is much more flexible

Feel free to copy this template and use it for personal or professional projects. It is only one of the numerous ways to do a presentation on LaTeX.
