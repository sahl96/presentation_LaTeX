# Full presentation done on LaTeX

This project is about creating a full presentation using only LaTeX. The main tex file you are looking for in "untitled.tex" (sorry for the lousy naming)

I believe LaTeX is much better than mainstream choices like Microsoft Powerpoint, because:

1) It is free 
2) It is much more flexible
3) The final document is a pdf hence its compatibility is much more reliable especially when operating across different platforms / computers.

Feel free to copy this template and use it for personal or professional projects. It is only one of the numerous ways to do a presentation on LaTeX.

This presentation allows you to upload videos  to your slides as well, however please note that in order to successfully run the video you need to open the PDF file in Adobe Reader.
